        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>
            Founded in 2015, the Ontario Community Adopt Center started with a simple mission: 
            to connect loving families with pets in need. What began as a small shelter 
            in Hamilton has grown into a province-wide network of volunteers, rescuers, and foster homes. 🐾
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe every dog deserves a second chance and a forever home. Over the years, 
            we've successfully matched over 2,000 pets with their perfect families — and we're just getting started!
        </p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            To rescue, rehabilitate and rehome dogs in Ontario through a caring, transparent and community-driven process.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            A world where no dog is left behind.
        </p>
